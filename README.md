# lean_fsm

Small example of a traffic light Finite State Machine (FSM) encoding in Lean, covering aspects of:

- Abstract state encoding
- Transition function
- State encoding 
- Output encoding

Example proofs:

- Safety (green lights in crossing directions is proven to never occur)
- Liveness (the system is proven never to get stuck)
